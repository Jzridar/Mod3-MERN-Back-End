**Introduction:** This is a simple E-Commerce project with basic operations like CRUD.
Where customer can perform the basic CRUD activity.
For the front end I've used HTML,CSS,Javascript and react. For the backend MERN stack is used.

**Technologies Used:**
**BACK END:** Mongoose,Express,React and NodeJS

**Getting Started:**
1. First I have created a basic backend folder with all the necessary files 
2. In the index.js I did some basic coding for express connection,MONGO DB connection and api listening and made sure that the port listening to localhost:5000.
3. Then I connected to MONGO DB using the config/db.js file and made sure everything working fine.

 + Models Folder: Created this folder to keep the user schema and the product schema
 + Controllers Folder : To perform CRUD operations.
 + Seeder Folder: Have four files for products,users and seeder.In this the users and products files are to feed the respective data that I randomly generated from the wesite called [MOCKAROO](www.mockaroo.com).


**Future Enhancements:**
Sign up and login credentials will be added.Might add the seller login also for 
each seller to sell their own product,order page will be created.
